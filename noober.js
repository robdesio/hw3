// Business Rules/Rubric
// With Noober, riders must specify the following data/criteria for their requested ride:

// Name
// Phone Number
// Pickup Location
// Dropoff Location
// Number of passengers in their party
// Whether or not they would like a luxury "Noober Purple" car
// There is code already provided that properly runs when the page is loaded or refreshed. This code does the work of reaching out to the rides API and obtaining a random ride â€“ 
//you should not modify this existing code; rather, begin the implmentation of the following requirements starting on line 15 of the code:

// Parse the data given in the random ride Object, and present it in human-readable format, for example: Noober X Passenger: Kiley Thompson - (260) 908-6886. 
//Pickup at 1301 N State Pkwy, Chicago, IL 60624. Drop-off at 2362 N Clybourn Ave, Chicago, IL 60657.
// (3 points) Approach the problem like we did in class â€“ write the recipe (algorithm) using comments, then write the code according to the recipe.
// (3 points) Create a well-named variable for each data point in the Object. For example, passengerFirstName. Then, use these variables to construct your string of output
// to be written to the JavaScript console.
// (2 points) Use conditional logic â€“ if the rider has requested the luxury "Purple" level of service, i.e. purpleRequested, display "Noober Purple" as the level of service, 
//e.g. Noober Purple Passenger: Freeman Waters...
// (2 points) If the numberOfPassengers in a single ride request is greater than 3, we'll need to upgrade to a larger car. Display "Noober XL" as the level of service.
// A request for Noober Purple supercedes the Noober XL logic. In other words, if a Noober Purple has been requested, it doesn't matter how many passengers there are. Anything else is the normal level of service, "Noober X".
